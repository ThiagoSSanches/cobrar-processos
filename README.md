# process-control
One more project done as a Alura student, thanks to the knowledge acquired 
after completing some courses offered there, in particular the course "Java: trabalhando com listas e coleções de dados", 
by Teachers Jacqueline Oliveira and Paulo Silveira! It's a aplication made to facilitate the control of processes, 
to see, to insert and to store informations like the process number and the demand deadline.
The project was done to exercise the following lessons: 
1) to sort a list in Java, by Collections.sort method;
2) to order objects that belong to project's classes, by implementing the Comparable interface in it;
3) to correctly implement the compareTo method, of the Comparable interface, 
making possible to see the list's elements in the correct order;
4) To learn that the ArrayList class implements the List interface;
5) To declare a list using the List interface, making possible the polymorphism 
with the flexibility of easy changes in the implementation thas is being instantiated.
